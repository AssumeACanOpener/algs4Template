algs4Template
=============

This is a template for projects from Coursera's Algorithms course, taught by Kevin Wayne and Robert Sedgewick.  This particular example implements and tests the three sum algorithm from the course text.

Sbt is used for the build tool.  The 3 basic sbt commands you'll need are "compile", "run", and "test".  Sbt expects java code to reside in src/main/java/ and tests to reside in src/test/java/.  To facilitate sharing between projects it's expected that course libraries, algs4.jar and stdlib.jar, reside in the ../lib directory.

A few junit examples are given as well in src/test/java/ThreeSumTest.java.  They should be pretty self explanatory.  Just make sure to put a "@Test" at the start of each test method.

Cheers.
